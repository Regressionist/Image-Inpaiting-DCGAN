# Image-Inpaiting-DCGAN
Implemented DCGAN architecture (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks) architecture to fill in the missing portions in an image (inspired by this [paper](http://iizuka.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/projects/completion/data/completion_sig2017.pdf)). With a fully-convolutional neural network, the images produced are both locally and globally consistent.
